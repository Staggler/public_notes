# [Black-market ecosystem Estimating the cost of “Pwnership”](https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/us/Documents/risk/us-risk-black-market-ecosystem.pdf)
#### Methodology
Pricing is for August 2017 and February 2018

## Services and Enablers 
Bullet Proof Hosting or BPH ~$8 to $130 per month
> BPH operators are a critical component of the cyber-criminal ecosystem and enable nearly every type of threat actor,novice, and expert. As such, the disruption of a BPH service has significant implications as a multitude of threat actors see their criminal businesses abruptly end when a BPH service shuts down.

Fast flux ~$70 to $500 per month.
>Many of the most popular BPH services offer dedicated “fast-flux” capabilities where nameservers and proxy front-end exit nodes are rapidly changed

SOCKS Proxy ~$38 to $750 (large price discrepancy based off of the composition of the botnet) 
>One of the most common uses of SOCKS proxy services is to mask brute-forcing, scanning, or account checking activities by distributing the threat actors traffic across hundreds or thousands of compromised host IP addresses. In the case of account checking, SOCKS proxies can be tailored to imitate the specific geographies of the organizations—most commonly financial institutions—where the accounts originated

VPN ~$10 to around $60 per month
>When threat actors interact with criminal infrastructure or perform any criminally related activity such as accessing forums, they will likely most often use a VPN or a series of VPNs to disassociate themselves from any incriminating activity.

Traffic Direction Services or TDS ~$100 and $583 per month
>TDS vendors support click fraud and also serve as a distribution channel for malware. 

>These can be further refined based on geography to infect users from specific countries or regions. This capability is reflected in pricing models as traffic from certain geographies is considerably easier to obtain.

Account Checkers ~$25 and $100 depending on the targeted organization.
>Account checkers are commonly developed in-house or rented out by threat actors that manage and sell compromised account credentials

>Threat actors that manage their own online markets of compromised account credentials often utilize custombuilt account checkers to replenish inventory.

>Conversely, they could use a web-based service like HDC3CK which charges based on the number of valid accounts identified.

>Account checker scripts iterate through a list of proxies and leverage proxy/VPN services to host the account checker to evade network blacklists. In addition, account checker scripts often randomize the User-Agent string to further obfuscate the scripts from valid web traffic.
