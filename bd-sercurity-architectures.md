# Notes on security in big data architectures

###(Securing Big Data Hadoop: A Review of Security ssues, Threats and Solution)[https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/feda/d0e2e8a2eb2a81a572679c233ee94b1a2bf8.pdf]
> We have identified three categories of security violation: unauthorized release of information, unauthorizedmodification of information and denial of resources. 

Security Issues:
* *Fragmented Data:* hard to map data to an individual hardware node. 
* *Distributed Computing:* 
* *Controlling Data Acess:*
* *Node to Node communication:* 
* *Client Interaction*
* *Virtually no security*
